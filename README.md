# Medical_Lab
This is a medical laboratory management system based on the OSGi (Open-Source Gateway Initiative) framework. Easy Way is a medical laboratory which patients can test their health and get lab reports. Our medical lab consists of three tiers, a service tier in which bundles act as producers (appointment producer, chemical producer, test report producer lab test producer and login producer), a controller tier where bundles act as both producers and consumers (patient consumer, lab assistant consumer, medical rep consumer and technician consumer) and a presentation tier which act as the main consumer.
